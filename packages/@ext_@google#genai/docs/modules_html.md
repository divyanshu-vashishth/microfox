This content only lists modules within the `@google/genai` package.  It doesn't provide any information about the types or functions within those modules, making it impossible to generate detailed documentation according to the specified format.  Please provide the actual TypeScript code for the functions and types you want documented.  For example, if you want documentation for the `chats` module, please provide the code for that module.


Once you provide the code, I can generate the documentation according to the format you specified.
